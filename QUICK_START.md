- [ ] Name: `DeadDays`
- [ ] Location: `D:\Github\DeadDays`
- [ ] Click "Create Project"

- [ ] Wait for packages to import
- [ ] Close Package Manager

### Step 4: Configure Project Settings (5 min)
- [ ] Go to Edit > Project Settings > Physics 2D
- [ ] Set Gravity Y to 0
- [ ] Go to Tags and Layers
- [ ] Add Tags: `Player`, `Zombie`, `Wall`, `Door`, `Item`
- [ ] Add Layers: `Player` (6), `Enemy` (7), `Obstacle` (8), `Interactable` (9)
- [ ] Close Project Settings

### Step 5: Create Game Scene (10 min)
- [ ] In Project window, navigate to Assets/Scenes/
- [ ] Create 2 new scenes: `MainMenu.unity`, `Game.unity`
- [ ] Open `Game.unity` (double-click)
- [ ] In Hierarchy, create Empty GameObject, name it `GameManager`
- [ ] Add Component > GameManager (script should auto-attach)
- [ ] Create 4 more Empty GameObjects: `TimeManager`, `SaveManager`, `AudioManager`, `SkillSystem`
- [ ] Attach corresponding scripts to each (Add Component > script name)
- [ ] Verify no red errors in Inspector

### Step 6: Set Up Lighting (5 min)
- [ ] In Hierarchy, right-click > Light > Global Light 2D
- [ ] Set Intensity: 1.0, Color: White
- [ ] Select `TimeManager` in Hierarchy
- [ ] Drag "Global Light 2D" to the `globalLight` field in Inspector
- [ ] Verify field shows "Global Light 2D" (not "None")

### Step 7: Create Player Prefab (10 min)
- [ ] In Hierarchy, right-click > 2D Object > Sprites > Square
- [ ] Rename to `Player`
- [ ] Add Component > Rigidbody 2D
  - [ ] Set Body Type: Dynamic
  - [ ] Set Gravity Scale: 0
  - [ ] Check "Freeze Rotation Z" under Constraints
- [ ] Add Component > Capsule Collider 2D
- [ ] Add Component > PlayerController
- [ ] Add Component > PlayerStats
- [ ] Add Component > PlayerInventory
- [ ] Add Component > PlayerCombat
- [ ] Set Layer to "Player" (top of Inspector)
- [ ] Set Tag to "Player"
- [ ] Drag Player from Hierarchy to Assets/Prefabs/ folder (creates prefab)

### Step 8: Create Zombie Prefab (10 min)
- [ ] In Hierarchy, right-click > 2D Object > Sprites > Square
- [ ] Rename to `Zombie_Walker`
- [ ] Add Component > Rigidbody 2D (same settings as Player)
- [ ] Add Component > Capsule Collider 2D
- [ ] Add Component > ZombieAI
- [ ] In ZombieAI component:
  - [ ] Set Zombie Type: Walker
  - [ ] Set Player Layer: "Player"
  - [ ] Set Obstacle Layer: "Obstacle"
- [ ] Change Sprite Renderer color to Red (for visibility)
- [ ] Set Layer to "Enemy"
- [ ] Set Tag to "Zombie"
- [ ] Drag Zombie from Hierarchy to Assets/Prefabs/

### Step 9: Test Basic Gameplay (5 min)
- [ ] Ensure Player and 1-2 Zombies are in scene
- [ ] Position Player at (0, 0, 0)
- [ ] Position Zombies at (5, 5, 0) and (-5, -5, 0)
- [ ] Press PLAY button (top center)
- [ ] Test movement with WASD keys
- [ ] Test sprint with Shift key
- [ ] Observe zombies wandering/chasing
- [ ] Press PLAY again to stop

## üéÆ VERIFY IT WORKS

### Movement Test
- [ ] WASD moves the player
- [ ] Shift makes player run faster
- [ ] Player sprite faces movement direction
- [ ] No errors in Console window

### Zombie AI Test
- [ ] Zombies wander randomly when player is far
- [ ] Zombies chase player when close (< 10 units)
- [ ] Zombies change to red when chasing (or maintain color)
- [ ] Console shows "Zombie entered state: Chase" when close

### Combat Test
- [ ] Left click near zombie deals damage
- [ ] Zombie flashes red when hit
- [ ] Zombie dies after multiple hits
- [ ] Console shows "Zombie died!" message

### Time System Test
- [ ] Select TimeManager in Hierarchy
- [ ] Set Day Length In Seconds: 120 (2 minutes)
- [ ] Press Play
- [ ] Observe lighting changing over 2 minutes
- [ ] Console shows "Day X - Dawn has arrived" messages

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Scripts have errors"
**Solution:** Wait for Unity to finish compiling (bottom-right corner). If errors persist, reimport scripts: Right-click Assets/Scripts > Reimport.

### "Player doesn't move"
**Solution:** 
1. Check PlayerController has Rigidbody2D assigned in Inspector
2. Ensure Gravity Scale is 0
3. Check Console for error messages

### "Zombies don't chase player"
**Solution:**
1. Verify ZombieAI has "Player" layer selected in `playerLayer` field
2. Ensure Player GameObject has Layer set to "Player"
3. Check zombie's vision range is 10+ in ZombieAI component

### "Time cycle doesn't work"
**Solution:**
1. Ensure Universal RP package is installed
2. Verify TimeManager has Global Light 2D assigned in `globalLight` field
3. Check dayLengthInSeconds is not 0

### "Everything is white squares"
**Expected!** You haven't imported sprites yet. This is normal. Systems work, just no art yet.
