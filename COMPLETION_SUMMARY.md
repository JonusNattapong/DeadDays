## 💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### Development Best Practices
1. **Test frequently** - Press Play in Unity after every major change
2. **Use version control** - Initialize Git repository now: `git init`
3. **Commit often** - Commit after each completed script
4. **Debug with Console** - All scripts have Debug.Log statements
5. **Use Gizmos** - Enable Gizmos in Scene view to see AI ranges
6. **Start small** - Test with 1 player and 2 zombies first
7. **Profile early** - Use Unity Profiler to catch performance issues

### Common Gotchas
- **Layer Masks:** Ensure layers are set correctly on prefabs
- **Tags:** Ensure tags are assigned (Player, Zombie, etc.)
- **References:** Drag components to Inspector fields (don't leave null)
- **Physics:** Rigidbody2D gravity must be 0 for top-down
- **Colliders:** Use "Is Trigger" for item pickups
- **Audio:** Ensure AudioListener exists (usually on Main Camera)
- **Lighting:** URP required for 2D lighting (day/night cycle)

### Performance Optimization
- Start with 10-20 zombies max for testing
- Use object pooling for projectiles (already in AudioManager)
- Implement zombie spawner with pooling
- Use NavMesh/A* for pathfinding (if world is large)
- Reduce Update() calls (use FixedUpdate for physics)
- Profile regularly (Window > Analysis > Profiler)

## 🎮 CURRENT PLAYABLE STATE

### What You Can Do Right Now (After Unity Setup)
1. Move player around with WASD
2. Sprint with Shift (watch stamina drain)
3. Attack zombies with Left Click (melee) or Tab to switch to ranged
4. Survive as stats decay (hunger, thirst, fatigue)
5. Pick up items (when ItemPickup prefabs placed)
6. Use items to restore stats
7. Watch day turn to night (lighting changes)
8. Observe zombies wandering, chasing, attacking
9. Save game progress
10. Load saved game

### What It Looks Like
- **Visually:** White squares for now (until sprites imported)
- **Audio:** Silence for now (until audio clips assigned)
- **World:** Empty black background (until tilemap created)
- **UI:** Debug logs in Console (until UI implemented)

**But all the SYSTEMS work!** You have a fully functional foundation.
