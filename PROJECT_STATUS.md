## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES / TODO

### Critical
- [ ] No Unity project file (.unityproject) - needs Unity initialization
- [ ] No scene files created yet (MainMenu, Game, Training)
- [ ] No prefabs created (Player, Zombie variants, Items)
- [ ] No item database - items are created programmatically
- [ ] No ML-Agents package installed
- [ ] No Python environment configured

### High Priority
- [ ] SkillSystem not implemented - skills referenced but don't work
- [ ] No crafting recipes defined
- [ ] No world generation - empty world on start
- [ ] No UI - all feedback is debug logs
- [ ] No animations assigned to animators
- [ ] No audio clips assigned to AudioManager

### Medium Priority
- [ ] PlayerController isometric transformation needs tuning
- [ ] ZombieAI pathfinding is basic (needs NavMesh or A*)
- [ ] No minimap system
- [ ] No quest/objective system
- [ ] No save slot selection (single save only)
- [ ] No difficulty settings

### Low Priority
- [ ] No gamepad support
- [ ] No achievements system (structure exists in README)
- [ ] No statistics screen
- [ ] No leaderboards
- [ ] No tutorial system

## 💡 NOTES

### Design Decisions Made
1. **Binary Serialization:** Chosen for save system (fast, compact). Consider JSON for debugging.
2. **Singleton Pattern:** Used extensively for manager access. Could use dependency injection later.
3. **Isometric View:** Implemented as transformation in PlayerController. May need tilemap adjustments.
4. **Combat Modes:** Separated melee/ranged for clarity. Could merge if needed.
5. **Zombie Types:** 7 variants with clear roles. Easy to balance individually.
6. **Stats System:** 7 core stats affect all gameplay. Well-integrated across systems.

### Performance Considerations
- Audio object pooling implemented (10 initial, expands as needed)
- Binary save format for fast I/O
- Rigidbody2D for physics (efficient for 2D)
- Consider object pooling for zombies/projectiles in spawner
- NavMesh/A* pathfinding needed for larger worlds

### Unity Setup Required
1. Create new Unity 2021.3+ project (2D template)
2. Install packages:
   - ML-Agents (com.unity.ml-agents)
   - 2D Pixel Perfect
   - TextMeshPro
3. Import art assets to Sprites folders
4. Create animator controllers with proper states
5. Set up layers: Player, Enemy, Obstacle, Interactable
6. Set up tags: Player, Zombie, Wall, Door, Container, Item
7. Create scenes: MainMenu, Game, Training
8. Build prefabs: Player, Zombie variants, Items
9. Configure Physics2D collision matrix

### Python Setup Required
1. Install Python 3.8+
2. Create virtual environment
3. Install packages:
   ```bash
   pip install mlagents torch numpy matplotlib pandas
   ```
4. Configure zombie_training.yaml (exists in README)
5. Test training connection with Unity
